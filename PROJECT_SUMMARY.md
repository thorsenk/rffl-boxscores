## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Export Functionality**
- Fetches ESPN fantasy football boxscores via API
- Supports both public and private leagues
- Cookie-based authentication for private leagues
- Configurable week ranges
- Clean CSV output with normalized data

### 2. **Validation System**
- Verifies data consistency and completeness
- Checks projection vs actual point totals
- Validates starter counts (should be 9 per team)
- Configurable tolerance for floating-point differences
- Generates detailed validation reports

### 3. **Data Normalization**
- Standardizes roster slot names (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, D/ST, K, Bench, IR)
- Handles injury status and bye week information
- Rounds points to 2 decimal places for consistency
- Separates starters from bench players

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **CLI Framework**: Uses Typer for modern, type-safe command-line interface
2. **Data Processing**: Pandas for efficient data manipulation and CSV export
3. **API Integration**: ESPN API client for fantasy football data access
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network issues and invalid data

### Key Functions

- `_export()`: Main export logic with data processing
- `_validate()`: Data validation and consistency checking
- `_norm_slot()`: Slot position normalization
- `_iter_weeks()`: Week-by-week data iteration
- `Row` dataclass: Structured data representation

## 📊 Output Format

The tool exports CSV files with the following columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `week` | int | NFL week number |
| `matchup` | int | Matchup number within week |
| `team_abbrev` | str | Team abbreviation |
| `team_proj_total` | float | Team's projected total points |
| `team_actual_total` | float | Team's actual total points |
| `slot` | str | Player's roster slot |
| `slot_type` | str | "starters" or "bench" |
| `player_name` | str | Player's name |
| `position` | str | Player's position |
| `injured` | bool | Injury status |
| `injury_status` | str | Detailed injury status |
| `bye_week` | bool | Whether player is on bye |
| `projected_points` | float | Player's projected points |
| `actual_points` | float | Player's actual points |

## 🔧 Installation & Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Test installation
python test_installation.py

# Export data (public league)
rffl-bs export --league 323196 --year 2024

# Validate exported data
rffl-bs validate validated_boxscores_2024.csv
```

### Private League Access

```bash
# Set environment variables
export ESPN_S2="your_espn_s2_cookie_value"
export SWID="{your_swid_cookie_value}"

# Export with authentication
rffl-bs export --league 123456 --year 2024
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

The project includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Installation Test**: `test_installation.py` verifies all components work
2. **CLI Testing**: All commands show proper help and error handling
3. **Data Validation**: Built-in validation ensures data quality
4. **Example Usage**: `example_usage.py` demonstrates all features
