# Save AI Response Only as Knowledge Entry

## Full Prompt (Detailed)
```
Please save your previous response(s) as a knowledge entry using the knowledge_entry_template.md format.

Focus only on your AI response(s) - not the user's questions or the full conversation thread.

Use the following information:
- **Topic:** [Main topic/subject of your response]
- **Learning Level:** [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]
- **Tags:** [comma-separated relevant tags]

Structure your response content into the template sections:
1. **Original Context:** Brief description of what the user asked
2. **Knowledge Synthesis:** Your complete response content, organized and detailed
3. **Key Insights:** Main points from your response
4. **Practical Applications:** How to use/apply the information you provided
5. **Related Commands/Files:** Any specific commands, files, or references you mentioned
6. **Future Learning Path:** Suggested next steps based on your response

Save the file in the Knowledge Library with the naming convention: 
`knowledge_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_[topic].md`

Make sure to capture the full value and context of your response as a standalone reference document.
